<h2>Eagle Attack</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Eagles must drop objects onto targets while flying.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Animal Attack.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Skill based game play.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game should somehow simulate a plane dropping bombs. Player will experience urgency and excitement!!!!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Player will shape his/her hand to mimic the Spiderman grip. (Open hand then press your middle and ring finger onto your palm). The index finger will be considered the head of the eagle and you ring and middle the claws. </li>
    <li>Layout the targets and ball onto the table/floor spread out.</li>
    <li>At the start of the game, the “eagle” will “fly” around the table, always at a constant speed.</li>
    <li>Eagle must fly low and pick up objects.</li>
    <li>Once it has done so, the eagle must get height and then, while traveling at fast speed, drop the object at the targets.</li>
    <li>Game can be play multiplayer, but limited number of objects to be dropped.</li>
    <li>Eagles can also drop object on top of other eagles when playing multiplayer.</li>
    <li>Scoring can be either assign per target hits, or to avoid cheat, height of drop.</li>
    <li>Hitting other eagles with the object will yield the score of a high drop</li>
</ul>
