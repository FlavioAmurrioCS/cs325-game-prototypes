<h2>Organ Revenge(Iteration)</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    There was a huge explosion and there are orgons flying everywhere. The nurse sees this opportunity and tries to catch as many organs as posible. (No body knows that the nurse caused the explosion.)
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This is a catch the falling object game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Randomness.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    The game was to design to give the player a challenge as the bodyparts start falling faster as she collects more organs.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player has very limited option in this game. To start the game, the player must click on the screen play with their mouse. Afterwards, the game will drop an organ. Then the player has the option of clicking either the left arrow key or the right arrow key to move the nurse character on screen left or right, respectfully. Now the nurse can also jump!!!
Game scoring has been changed as well as the font in order to make it more readable.
