<h2>Organ Revenge(Iteration)</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game is about a doctor that got fire from a hospital and nowhe has to get REVANGE by blowing up the hospital he work at and instead pick up all the organ parts and deliver them to patient and make alot of money by doing this
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
(CHANGE)
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game was created to have players have the expierence that they need to concentrate and in different body parts 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player has very limited option in this game. To start the game, the player must click on the screen play with their mouse. Afterwards, the game will drop an organ number . Then the player has the option of clicking either the left arrow key or the right arrow key to move the nurse character on screen left or right, respectfully.

To make it more fun I would have the game to have more sound effects, like everytime the player choose wrong letter to display a sad sounds, and when he selects the correct one to have a happy song.
Another function that would have been interesting to see is for the Roman numbers to be divided vy V and I, XL, and CM. As the level progreses the game should get harder and harder
